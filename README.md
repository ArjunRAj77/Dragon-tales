## System Design

The entire system is divided into 2 microservices.
- The Front End Streamlit Python application
- The Back End Springboot Java application

The backend utilises the Open AI chatGPT API services and the power of MongoDB Atlas to provide a seamless experience to the user.

Where as the front end UI is powered by Streamlit UI and the entire communication is happening through the dedicated API service of Dragon Tales.

The entire microservices are deployed and manged by Google Cloud services and Google Kuberenetes Engine.


The entire API documentation is available at : [Dragon Tales API docs](https://mongo-gcp-project.uc.r.appspot.com/swagger-ui/index.html#)
